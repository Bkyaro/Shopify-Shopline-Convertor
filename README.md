# Shopify-Shopline-Convertor
 ## Introduction
Shopify-Shopline-Convertor is a code conversion tool that helps you save time and effort when you need to move your liquid code from Shopify platform to Shopline platform. Shopify uses liquid as a development language while Shopline utilizes handlebars, which results in differences between these two platforms.
 ## How to Use
To use this tool, simply clone the repository and deploy it on Netlify by connecting to your own GitHub repository. Please note that this repository has some specific conversions for personal usage, so you may want to modify it according to your specific needs. Here is the link to deploy on Netlify: [Deploy on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/tags/deploy/).
 ## Known Issues
Shopify-Shopline-Convertor is based on [Liquid-To-Handlebars](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/liquid-to-handlebars) developed by jonschlinkert. However, since the repository has not been updated for a long time, some of the conversions may be out of date. Furthermore, the conversion tool does not cover all cases on Shopline, so it may be necessary to double-check the converted code and make necessary adjustments before deploying it to production.
